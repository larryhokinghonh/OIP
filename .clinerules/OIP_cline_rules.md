# Cline Project Rules — Glasgow Botanical Gardens ALAN Project

## 🌱 Project Context

This project presents a design thinking-based solution addressing the effects of Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) in the Glasgow Botanical Gardens. The final output is a **visually polished, fully structured static website** intended for public and stakeholder presentation.

⚠️ **Note**: This phase focuses solely on layout, structure, and design — **not on content**. Team members will populate the text and media later.

---

## 🎯 Primary Goal

- Build a **complete template website** with:
  - Fully responsive layout
  - Styled reusable components
  - Clear placeholder sections for team-written content
- Ensure the final export can be deployed to GitHub Pages with minimal additional setup

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (using App Router or Pages Router as configured)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Library**: ShadCN (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages via static export (`next export`)

---

## 🧭 Cline Behavior Guidelines

- Focus only on:
  - **Visual layout and design**
  - **Component structure and responsiveness**
  - **Placeholder text and content slots**
- Do not populate real content; use placeholders (`Lorem ipsum`, dummy images, etc.)
- Avoid unnecessary interactivity (no stateful components unless structurally needed)
- Ensure navigation is intuitive and usable on both desktop and mobile
